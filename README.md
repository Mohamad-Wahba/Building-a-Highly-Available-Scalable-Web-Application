# Building-a-Highly-Available-Scalable-Web-Application

## AWS Lab Project solution Overview
This solution presents a high-level architecture for a scalable and highly available web application hosted on AWS. It leverages key AWS services to create a robust infrastructure, including a VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, an Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution, EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group for the web tier, and an RDS instance for the database tier. The design incorporates security best practices with appropriate use of Security Groups and IAM roles. This overview provides a general structure of the solution without detailing specific implementation steps, allowing for individual exploration and learning within the AWS Academy lab environment. The architecture aims to meet the project requirements while adhering to AWS best practices and the constraints of the lab setting.
